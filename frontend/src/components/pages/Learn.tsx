      "A boxing stance is the foundation of balance, mobility, power, and defense in the ring. It ensures stability while throwing punches or dodging attacks, allowing smooth movement and efficient footwork. A proper stance helps generate power by transferring energy from the legs and hips while also maintaining defensive positioning to block or evade strikes. It enhances endurance by conserving energy, preventing unnecessary movement and fatigue. The two primary stances—orthodox (left foot forward) and southpaw (right foot forward)—set the stage for a boxer’s effectiveness. Mastering stance is essential for control, precision, and overall success in boxing.",
